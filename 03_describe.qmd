Here we will describe the dataset:

- PCA on dataset of all the variables we chose to include to find what variables actually influence the decition of introducitn catherization
- divide into two catagories, soscioeconomic factors and physical factors: Find when a patient recieves RHC based on different diseases. Find how well the treatment works in terms based on death rate. Does income, edu, insurance, race, (sex?), influence when a patient actually recieves the treatment?


- cat1 and cat2 are primary and secondary disease category
```{r}
rhc_data |> group_by(cat1,cat2) |> summarise(n = n())
```



```{r}
rhc_data |> select(ends_with("hx")) |> summarise(n =n())
```
